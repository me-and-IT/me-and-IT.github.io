**Friday the 11th**

Last Friday we changed  the background colour for our websites and as you can see there is a huge difference therefore my blog looks MUCH better.

What went well? For me everything went well the colours worked very well and now I am very satisfied with my website and I think  it looks very good. However it took a long time for me to choose a background that goes with the colour of the text so I think that should be my even better if.

    <td>Today we learnt that finding discount codes is actually much harder as just using the first to figures means it is very easy to forge a discount code. So today we had to create a new sheet titled 'Discount Codes'. In this sheet we created a list of specific codes and then we went back to the ‘Order Form’ sheet. We then used the =VLOOKUP formula again to verify if the code was valid or not. We had to finish off the ‘Discount Sheet’ by adding more codes to it to make it seem more realistic and business-like. This method was a lot harder than the first method but it helped expand my understanding of the subject.

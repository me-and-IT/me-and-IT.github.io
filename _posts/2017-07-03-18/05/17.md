    <td>Like last time, I tried to read the text on the side as thoroughly as I could (but I did rush through it sometimes which made it quite hard for me to complete the task) and this time I tried to type faster but it didn't really work. I learnt that if I don't read the text slowly the task doesn't make any sense.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I am quite annoyed that I only got to the middle of 14% so I definitely need to try and work faster. I also need to ask other people for help when needed as I do most of my work by myself which does not get me very far. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>In the next lesson I will focus on my work so I can get more done but I will also ask for help if needed.I will read and type faster again  to also help me get more work done quickly. My goal for next week is to finish 14%.</td>

Friday the 15

On Friday we looked at a Kia Soul advert. In the advert there were three fat hamsters who were working out at the same time that the new Kia Soul car was being made. The hamsters were the first people to drive the new car and when they stepped onto the red carpet they had 'totally transformed' from what they used to be and so had the new car. Our homework was to find a piece of media literacy and fill out a sheet on it. I think that my WWW is that I found a good example of media literacy. My EBI is that it was actually really hard to find a good example.

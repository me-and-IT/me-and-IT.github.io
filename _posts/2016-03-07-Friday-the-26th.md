Friday the 26th

On Friday we had to hand in our identity map. Making the identity map was quite easy as I was writing about me and I am the only person who knows me best (if that makes any sense). But sharing it with the rest of the rest of the class was the hard bit. I didn't want anyone to dislike me because of it or leave a bad comment. I don’t particularly like being rude to people which is why I really don’t like it if someone was rude to me. I would rather have presented myself and answered everyone’s question there and then. All of the comments I received were either positive or were just jokes which made me feel relieved. It is different to commenting online as if you are doing it in front of 29 people that you know quite well you are probably not going to write something bad because then everyone will turn against you whereas online it completely different. It gave me lots of ideas for what I could post in the future to become successful in life. There is no  changes I want to make in the media I use based on this activity. I have changed my views on social media as I realised it could be a good and and a bad thing (but I think sometimes mostly bad).  I also think I should be a little more careful when using social media.

**Friday the 27th**

On friday we did something fantastic! We made our very own website and that was probably the best and most fun IT lesson I have ever had! We did this by using a website called github and also something called Gabriel. 

What went well? My first post came up almost as soon as published it which means that I did everything right and it all worked. However there were some **very** hard parts. One of them was to make a username and that was very hard as thousands of people use this website and most of the usernames I thought of were already taken! Furthermore if we typed up our email account wrong everything would mess up and it would not work (but luckily that didn't happen to me).

 

Apart from those things the lesson was very fun and everything went really well

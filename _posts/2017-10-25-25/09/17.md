    <td>Today we carried on with our 'Order Form' sheet. Today we added some new sections which were: Subtotal, Delivery, Discount, VAT and Grandtotal. The delivery and VAT costs were the easiest parts as all we needed to do was multiply the number by a negative or decimal number to subtract a certain amount off the total. However, the discount was the harder part. The discount took a very long time as it there was many steps to getting the actual code. First we had to create a random code which was very easy but it had to have a specific start for the first two letters or numbers. This would make it easier to validate the discount codes. We created a table which had a codeâ€™s beginning two figures and the how much the discount was for that code. We validated the code by using the =LEFT formula and found out the first two figures of the code. Then we put in that discount into the discount section.

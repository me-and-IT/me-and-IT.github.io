    <td>Today we learnt how to learn coding using google sheets. We started off by using basic codes like the =SUM formula which let us add up different cells and the =PRODUCT formula which let us multiply different cells. We created another sheet and we created a table in it showing a product code, it's name,the price, the quantity and the total price. We named the sheet 'Order Form’ and then we created another sheet titled ‘stocklist’. In this sheet we listed a variety of products a unique code for each of them and their price. We went back to the ‘Order Form’ sheet and created a complex formula called the =VLOOKUP formula. This formula was used to find information from other sheets and enter them into a different sheet. We were told to finish this for homework.  I found this very tricky and I needed help to finish it.

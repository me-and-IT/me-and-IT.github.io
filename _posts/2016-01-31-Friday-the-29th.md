Friday the 29th

On Friday our class discussed the advantages and disadvantages of social media. We came up with lots of good examples of them e.g. Making friends, fame and easy/quick communication. Which is why this should be our WWW. However we found it hard to explain our examples fully and thoroughly so that should obviously not be our EBI. Just kidding, it should be our EBI.

    <td>Today we were told to finish off and clean up everything that we had done over the past few weeks. I found that there had been a lot more minor errors than I expected so this lesson was really useful for me as I never really had time to go through all of the sheets and check for errors. We also learnt how to attach our google sheets work to our blog. First we would go into Google Sheets, go to file then go to share and click on 'get shareable link' and copy the link. Then we would have to publish the blog, then we would log into github and go to ‘_posts’. After we would go into edit, scroll right to the bottom of the code and we would put in ‘hr’ and ‘br’ to create a space and a line and then paste in the code. Then when we commit changes and check back to our blog the work should be there.

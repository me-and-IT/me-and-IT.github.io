**Computers**

Computers consist of lots of different things e.g. the monitor and the actual computer. I am going to tell you about them:

**Peripherals**

The peripherals are the inputs and outputs of that the computer has e.g.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>INPUTS</td>
    <td>microphone</td>
    <td>camera</td>
    <td>scanner</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>OUTPUTS</td>
    <td>speakers</td>
    <td>monitor</td>
    <td>printer</td>
  </tr>
</table>


**Hard drive**

Hard drives is where all the **information** you have used is stored. **IT IS NOT TO BE MISTAKEN WITH THE RAM!**

**RAM**

This is an acronym for the words **R**andom **A**ccess **M**emory. This is where your **memory** is stored. 

**CPU**

This is an acronym for **C**entral **P**rocessing **U**nit. The CPU is used to **Process **data. Whatever we do on the computer, like playing games, all of that data will be processed in the CPU.

**Internet security**

**Viruses**

A virus is a program that is designed by someone to trouble you by hacking into your device. It will spread by downloading itself into some other files.

**Malware**

By putting the words 'malicious' and ‘software’ together you get the word ‘malware’. It is the general term for an unwanted program that is downloaded onto your device.

**WOrm**

This is a remote - control software that replicates itself onto another computer/device using access to the internet. They are used to damage large numbers of internet - connected computers.

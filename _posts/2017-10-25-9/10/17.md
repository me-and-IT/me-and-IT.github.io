    <td>Today we created 3 more new sheets titled 'Payroll', ‘Costs’ and ‘Sales sheet’. The easiest one to finish was the ‘Sales sheet’ as all we had to do for this sheet is to list numbers and give them a cost. The ‘Payroll’ sheet listed the workers and their pay but this sheet was not as easy as it sounds. First we created a table with the workers’ names, then we added the wage (hourly pay) and then we added the hours they worked. Then we found out their weekly wage by multiplying the sub-total by 5. Then we found out the yearly cost by multiplying that by 36 as they do not work all year. However, we also had to subtract the income tax and when we did that we found their true yearly wage. The costs sheet was easy as well as all we had to do was list the things that the company should or could pay for.</td>

    <td>Today the class started a program to teach us to code. I learned a lot from the lesson because I read the whole of the explanation as well as the instructions. Reading the explanation as well as the instructions was very effective as otherwise you wouldn't really learn or understand anything.</td>

    <td>I did get more work than I expected done but I think I could have done more work if I typed a bit faster as my typing was very slow. I also should have read a bit faster as well as I took longer than I needed to to read the text.</td>

**Friday the 4th**

Before Friday it was not possible to post pictures on my blog. However on Friday we changed all that. We added an extra piece of information to github that meant we would be able to post images and different types of fonts on my blog!

What went well? Everything went well for me. Now I am able to post images on my blogs whenever I want. However for other people things didn't go so well at all. They weren?t able to post images and even worse they weren?t able to post anything at all.

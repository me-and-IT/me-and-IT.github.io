    <td>I learnt by taking turns in programming and I tried to alter some things and see if they worked or not which helped widen my knowledge of coding and programming FUZE boxes and how they work.</td>

    <td>The fact that I am quite slow at typing meant I did not get to finish programme 4 on the FUZE box. Also the fact that I had to fix this blog kind of slowed me down as well.</td>

    <td>I will try and type faster and also try to fix and alter my blog before hand. I will also try to get my teacher to help me if I don't understand something or how something works</td>

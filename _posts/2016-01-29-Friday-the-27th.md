Friday the 22nd

On Friday we looked at some photoshopped adverts which are used for big companies such as McDonald's. What they do is that they put all their ingredients on top of each other but leaning back so that you can see all the ingredients. They also edit it so that the slightest bit of cheese isn’t poking out. A normal McDonald’s burger would take about two minutes to make but the ones that they use for advertising take hours to make which shows how perfect they have to be. Not only do they edit burgers they also edit people. Some of the greatest models don’t look anything like they do in adverts or movies
